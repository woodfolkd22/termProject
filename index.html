                The first step in my five year plan is to work as an investment banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. While therem I look forward to the porspect of alligning 100's of various pitch books and learning the ins and outs of the deal making process. While 80 hour weeks will certainly be a test of my professional endourance, it'll all be worth it when I roll into my first closing dinner with a fresh pair of deal sleds.

        <p id="pesection">
             The next step in my five year plan would be moving on to private equity. After being an investment banking plead for 2 to 3 years, a move to buy side will be much needed for both my wallet and my sanity. In an ideal world, I'd like to work a PE firm based on the south (preferable Savannah or Atlanta). It is during this time that I'll be able to send "pls fix... thx" to an analyst on my team. I deeply look forwad to this day.

        <p id="bschoolsection">
            The last step in my five year plan is to attend business school. After 4 to 5 years of the gruilling work force grind, a return to acadamia will be much need. I look foward to engaging in countless coffee chats with my fellow MBA students and maybe even finding someone to cofound a busines venture with.
